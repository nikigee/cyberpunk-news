            "content": "<p>Psychics are a very rare breed in the world. There’s a lot of questions when it comes to them and the Shroud in general, and modern science has come up with very few answers.</p>\n\n<p>All that’s known is that decades ago the first Incursions happened on Earth. Various pockets or psionic gateways popped up across the world rather sporadically. The news blared, people predicted apocalypse and braced for the worst, but nothing ever happened. Turns out these gateways were linked to another dimension which people referred to as ‘The Shroud’ due to its dream like haze and mysterious nature. The first incursions seemed to ‘awake’ various latent psychic abilities in people across the world. It was later determined that The Shroud and these latent psionic abilities were intrinsically connected to our conscious experiences and seemed to hint at the idea that the human mind was more than just our brains.</p>\n\n<p>Only about 1% of the global population ever develops psychic powers and most experience rather unimpressive feats. A few bent spoons, clairvoyance, but very few of those go on to do the impressive stuff like cause explosions or bend the wills of others, but when it happens, it can be scary as a mere mortal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/matrix/images/9/92/Neo_spoon.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20060716024920\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 1 - The Matrix (1999)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>To some extent, these powers can be cultivated and trained but the exact methods to do so highly depend on the individual since these powers are directly linked to a person’s consciousness and willpower, and this makes everything complicated as we’re all very different.</p>\n\n<p>Unless your part of the fortunate few who managed to seek help from powerful psychics or ‘off-the-book’ mentors yourself, there’s not many places you can go to understand or strengthen your powers as a psychic. In today’s world you must rely on your own wits and inner strength – just be careful who you confide in. You wouldn’t want the Cyber Psycho squad called on you. If you’re not being scary about it, you’ll be fine. Hopefully.</p>\n \n <figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885083261997563944/1209720709773926460/minovo-wang-20151282.jpg?ex=65e7f334&is=65d57e34&hm=8200abb079988bb882e4d8ef0cfcb9ea4e0e7cc4ea407e89519c0b14b6a41faf&\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 2 - C-TAC, Cyber/Psycho Tactical Division (Europe)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This has scared away a lot of military or corporate types as no training techniques has thus far has proved scalable or standardised. If you’re a marketing company for instance, there’s no point taking a risk with psychics to get people to purchase your product when advertising has been a proven field for centuries with plenty of psychological research and standardised techniques developed.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is perhaps more mysterious than the Shroud, where the only thing gleamed has been firsthand accounts and anecdotes from psychics who claim that its where they go when they dream and that their abilities simply allow them to glimpse the Shroud clearer than the rest of us. Modern science has thus far been unable to prove any link between dreams and the pockets generated by Shroud Incursions.</p>"

            "content": "The CEO of NanoDigital, Duncan Hammerhead, has once again caused controversy with his latest public outburst. This is not the first time that Mr. Hammerhead has sparked outrage with his inflammatory comments and divisive actions, and many are calling for him to be held accountable for his words and actions.</p>\n\n<p>The latest incident in question occurred during a conference call with investors and analysts, during which Mr. Hammerhead made a series of offensive and inflammatory comments. He reportedly used derogatory language to refer to certain groups of people and made dismissive and condescending remarks about his critics and detractors.</p>\n\n<p>These comments have sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many calling for Mr. Hammerhead to be held accountable for his words and actions. Several advocacy groups have called for him to be fired from his position at NanoDigital, and the company's stock price has taken a hit as a result of the controversy.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Mr. Hammerhead has faced similar backlash for his controversial actions and statements. Despite the backlash, he has continued to make offensive and divisive comments, leading many to question his judgment and suitability for his position as CEO of a major company.</p>\n\n<p>This latest incident is yet another reminder of the need for accountability and responsibility in leadership positions. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, but it is clear that Mr. Hammerhead's actions have serious consequences, and that he must be held accountable for his words and actions.</p>\n\n<p>We reached out to Industry Expert Michael Williams who had this to say:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://thumbnails.texastribune.org/8BEaLKHLy6kdUymiDERKjvkNtRM=/1200x804/smart/filters:quality(95)/static.texastribune.org/media/files/8617d0a602938cae4464ee6731989081/BD%20INC%20Williams%2021%202011\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 1 - Michael Williams, Industry Expert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p class=\"fst-italic\">\"As an expert in the technology industry, I have been following the developments at the NanoDigital Corporation with interest. In my opinion, the recent controversy surrounding CEO Duncan Hammerhead is a cause for concern, and raises questions about his suitability for his position.</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst-italic\">Mr. Hammerhead has a history of making offensive and divisive comments, and his latest outburst during a conference call with investors and analysts is simply the latest example of this behavior. This type of conduct is completely unacceptable, and has serious consequences for both the individual and the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst-italic\">In my view, Mr. Hammerhead's actions are a clear violation of the standards of professional conduct that are expected of a CEO. His comments are damaging to the reputation of NanoDigital, and could have serious consequences for the company's financial performance and long-term prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst-italic\">It is my opinion that Mr. Hammerhead should be held accountable for his words and actions, and that the board of directors at NanoDigital should consider taking appropriate action. This could include reprimanding him, issuing a formal apology, or even removing him from his position as CEO..\"</p>"

            "content": "In a world where cosmetic augmentations have become a widespread trend, concerns are mounting over the detrimental effects on body image and self-esteem, particularly among women who are unable to afford these costly enhancements. The increasing influence of celebrities flaunting their augmented features has created a culture where natural beauty seems overshadowed and individuals without such enhancements often feel inferior and inadequate.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of cosmetic augmentations, ranging from nano-enhancements to cybernetic modifications, has created a new standard of beauty, perpetuated by media and celebrity culture. Women, in particular, are bombarded with images and messages that idolize augmented appearances, creating an unattainable ideal that leaves many feeling pressured to conform.</p>\n\n<p>The socio-economic implications are significant, as the cost of cosmetic augmentations remains prohibitively high for many. This has created a clear divide between those who can afford the enhancements and those who cannot. Consequently, a sense of exclusion and insecurity plagues those without access to these cosmetic procedures, further exacerbating feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/536930875791638529/1109838029054558328/Lizzy-Wizzy-1607714470.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 1 - Emmeline Dupont, French Model</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Amidst this sea of augmented faces, one woman stands out as a beacon of natural beauty. Jade Parker, a renowned singer and influencer, has captured the public's attention with her refusal to succumb to societal pressures. While others have embraced augmentations to enhance their features, Jade remains steadfast in her natural appearance.</p>\n\n<p>Her choice to forego cosmetic augmentations has resonated with many individuals who feel marginalized by society's obsession with artificial enhancements. Jade's confidence in her natural beauty sends a powerful message that self-acceptance and embracing one's uniqueness should be celebrated and cherished.</p>\n\n<figure>\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n        <p>\"[Jade's] natural beauty is truly remarkable. Her refusal to conform to artificial standards is inspiring. I'm a proud father, let me tell ya. She's showin' the world that you don't need all them artificial standards of beauty to be a success.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <figcaption class=\"blockquote-footer\">\n        Trenton Parker, CEO of Petrochem\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/536930875791638529/1109841434548375582/d4fee6eab935ef746643a45dfb25e8b1.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 2 - Jade Parker, @jadeparker.offical (Verge)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>However, Jade's stance has not come without challenges. The media and entertainment industry, often driven by profit and trends, have attempted to label her as an outlier or an exception to the norm. Yet, her refusal to conform has only reinforced the importance of embracing individuality and redefining beauty standards.</p>\n\n<p>Experts and activists have begun raising awareness about the negative impacts of this augmented beauty culture, advocating for a more inclusive and body-positive approach. They stress the significance of acknowledging that beauty should not be defined by cosmetic enhancements but rather by self-acceptance, diversity, and personal expression.</p>\n\n<p>As conversations around body image continue to gain momentum, it is crucial for society to reassess its values and redefine beauty norms. By celebrating natural beauty, appreciating diverse appearances, and promoting self-love, we can create a more inclusive environment that uplifts individuals from all walks of life.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://dm0qx8t0i9gc9.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/video/H5BOVymHiplawzr0/videoblocks-young-woman-running-through-a-wheat-field-in-a-fluttering-dress-back-view_r-vhagbnp_thumbnail-1080_01.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid\">\n    <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 3 - Stock Photo, Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In the face of a relentless pursuit of augmented perfection, Jade Parker's unwavering commitment to her natural beauty serves as a reminder that true beauty lies in authenticity and embracing what makes each individual unique. As society grapples with the influence of cosmetic augmentations, Jade's presence becomes a symbol of hope, empowering women to embrace their own natural beauty and reject the pressures of a manufactured ideal.</p>"
